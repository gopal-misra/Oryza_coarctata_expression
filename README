Please keep all the read data and script in one directory and run pipeline.sh. It will run all the steps and come out with the final box plot.

In only one step we need to manually curate one text file named as single_copy_homolog_Os_Oc.txt. Some of the Os genes showed hits with both KK and LL, but those KK-LL genes are not in homoeologous pairs. There were around 600 genes, so we removed them from the SCH list.
